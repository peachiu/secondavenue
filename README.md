## ⚙️ How to Deploy (Local Server)

To run this project locally, you will need a local server environment like **XAMPP** or **Wampserver**.

1.  **Download and Install:**
    *   [Download XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) or [Download Wampserver](https://www.wampserver.com/).
2.  **Project Location:**
    *   Copy the project folder to the server's root directory:
        *   **XAMPP:** `C:\xampp\htdocs\secondavenue`
        *   **Wampserver:** `C:\wamp64\www\secondavenue`
3.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Start **Apache** and **MySQL** from your server's control panel.
    *   Open your browser and visit: `http://localhost/secondavenue/setup_db.php`
    *   Wait for the "success" message. This will automatically create the database and tables.
4.  **Access the Website:**
    *   Enter `http://localhost/secondavenue/website/index.php` in your browser.
5.  **Important Note:**
    *   Ensure your MySQL user is `root` and has no password (default for both XAMPP and WAMP). If you have a different configuration, update the credentials in `backend/db.php`.
